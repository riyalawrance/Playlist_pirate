## 📖 About

**Playlist Pirate** is a cloud-powered Telegram bot that lets you send a Spotify playlist or album link and get back playable MP3s — no manual searching, no repeated downloads. It fetches accurate track metadata from the Spotify API, locates the best match on YouTube, downloads and converts the audio, and caches everything across **SQLite → Amazon S3 → Telegram File ID** so repeat requests are served almost instantly.

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Dependencies include: `python-telegram-bot`, `spotipy`, `yt-dlp`, `boto3`, `python-dotenv`

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token

CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=your_spotify_redirect_uri

## 💬 Usage

1. Open Telegram and start a chat with your bot.
2. Send `/start` to initialize the bot.
3. Paste a **Spotify playlist or album link**, for example:

```text

```

4. The bot fetches all tracks and displays them in a **paginated inline menu**.
5. Tap a track to download it — the bot will:
   - Check Telegram File ID cache → send instantly if found
   - Check S3 cache → download from S3 if found
   - Otherwise, search YouTube, download, convert to MP3, upload to S3, and send it to you

### Example Commands
